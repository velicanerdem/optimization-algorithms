## How to fork if you don't have access to TUBerlin Gitlab

Create an empty repository in your personal Gitlab or Github and clone it to your computer

```
git clone YOURREPOSITORY
cd YOURREPOSITORY
```

Make sure you are using the `main` branch (not `master`)

```
git checkout -b main
```

Add our repository as remote of name upstream

```
git remote add upstream https://git.tu-berlin.de/lis-public/oa-workspace.git
```

Now you can fetch and pull from the upstream. Don't forget the submodule. 

```
git pull upstream main
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Push to your own Gitlab/Github repository:

```
git push origin main
```
